    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Honestly, if it weren’t for that Disney movie about the rat, I doubt my kids would have been so eager to try my ratatouille recipe. But once they did, they were delighted and now it’s a dish I love to make when I feel like we should have something meatless. Made with a bounty of fresh, colorful vegetables, you’ll love the garden-fresh flavors in this tasty meal!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggplant</li>
        <li>Zucchini</li>
        <li>Roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>Carrot</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves and onion</li>
        <li>Dried Herbs</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375F. In a large nonstick pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium high heat. Add in the onion, garlic, and carrot and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Next, add in the crushed tomatoes and seasonings and simmer for 15 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Once the sauce has thickened, pour into a 2 quart baking dish. Arrange the sliced vegetables in a circular pattern standing upright in the dish over the sauce. Brush with the remaining olive oil. Cover and bake for 30 minutes, then uncover and bake until vegetables are tender. Serve immediately.</li>
